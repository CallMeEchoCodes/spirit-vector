## Fly Forth, Spirit Vector!

DBSV introduces the Spirit Vector, a pair of skates fueled by spirit energy. Wearing them changes your movement to momentum-based parkour, a challenging but skill-rewarding mode of travel. Beyond simple parkour mechanics like wall jumps, slides and vaults, the Spirit Vector can be upgraded with up to 3 Spirit Runes, unlocking special movement ability tricks activated in the air. Basic movements increase Poise; Poise is spent on rune abilities.

With great Poise, your wings are unveiled. 

## Mechanics

Dream Burst Spirit Vector is a mod about momentum, striving to capture the movement styles of games like Ultrakill and Jet Set Radio. This is not a Vanilla+ parkour extension; Wearing a Spirit Vector completely overhauls your movement.

The Spirit Vector is a pair of skates fueled by spirit energy. The only cost is Poise, or style -- Burst movements such as Wall Jumping and Ledge Vaulting increase your Poise, which decays as long as you are not Sliding or Wall Rushing.

Poise is spent on abilities tied to jumping, crouching or sprinting while in the air. You can customize the Spirit Vector by smithing it with a Spirit Rune to select the ability and a Vector Rune to select the slot.

## Tutorial

The basic movement of the Spirit Vector is too detailed to explain sufficiently on a webpage. [This demo world](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/dream-burst-spirit-vector-demo-world/) (MC 1.21) provides an in-depth overview of the starting movement set, along with some insights into more advanced techniques.
