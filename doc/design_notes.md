Current project: Adding two new spirit vector types, the Dream Vector and the Burst Vector.
Every Spirit Vector type has a distinct way of gaining and maintaining poise, a passive effect activated with sufficient poise ("soaring"), and slightly different movement capabilities.

The classic Spirit Vector is a versatile movement tool suitable for both racing and complex movement.
- Zero air drag, but movement cannot be adjusted while in mid-air (no air DI).
- Poise is gained by performing basic tricks like ledge/wall movements and (soon:tm:) rail grinding. Poise is not lost while sliding on the ground or along walls.
- Base walk speed is increased proportionally to poise.
- Ledge movements are additive to velocity, while wall jumps have a set velocity.
- Ledge vaults trade some horizontal speed for increased vertical.
- Stunts can be performed by holding opposite direction keys in mid-air, giving a small poise boost upon completion.

The Dream Vector is a modified longboard-like SV that focuses on long distance horizontal movement. Dream Vectors are popular among those who enjoy pathracing, long distance races moving uninterrupted across often very rugged terrain. The Dream Vector builds on the Spirit Vector's movement:
- At high speed, poise steadily increases while sliding and is not lost while in the air.
- While soaring, step height is doubled, making overcoming obstacles and debris significantly easier.
- Wallrushing can be performed indefinitely.
- Both ledge and wall movements are additive to velocity.

The Burst Vector specializes in vertical movement, excelling in aerial maneuvers and getting up into high places.
- Slightly reduced gravity, and slight air DI allowed.
- Poise only decays while touching the ground, and doesn't increase from basic tricks. Instead, successful stunts will completely refill poise.
- While soaring, gain increased air DI.
